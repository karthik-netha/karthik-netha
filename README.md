# 👋 Hi, I'm Karthik Koulampet

**Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC Engineer | Cloud Security | Python Automation**

Thanks for stopping by! I’ve spent the last 6+ years working in **SOC operations, SIEM (Azure Sentinel | Splunk | Exabeam)**, and **incident response**, helping organizations strengthen their threat detection and response capabilities.  

I enjoy exploring **threat detection, cloud security, and automation**—especially building things that make SOC life easier and more efficient. My current focus is on hands-on projects that bring together real-world investigation, scripting, and cloud monitoring.

## 🔭 Projects I’m Working On
- **SOC Simulation Lab:** Building a simulated SOC using **Splunk and Security Onion** to detect brute-force and privilege escalation attacks, mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**.  
- **Python Automation for Incident Response:** Automating IOC lookups and alert triage using **Python** and **VirusTotal APIs** to reduce manual investigation time.  
- **Vulnerability Dashboard:** Creating **Power BI and Python** dashboards to analyze CVSS trends, remediation timelines, and SLA compliance.  
- **Cloud Security Monitoring:** Setting up **AWS GuardDuty** and **Azure Defender** for real-time alerting on misconfigurations and policy violations.

## 🧰 Technical Toolkit
**SIEM & EDR:** Azure Sentinel | Splunk | Exabeam | Microsoft Defender | CrowdStrike  
**Vulnerability Management:** Tenable .sc | Qualys | Nessus  
**Cloud Security:** AWS GuardDuty | Security Hub | Azure Defender | IAM | KMS | CloudTrail  
**Automation & Scripting:** Python | PowerShell | Bash | Logic Apps  
**Frameworks & Compliance:** NIST 800-61 | MITRE ATT&CK | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 | HIPAA
